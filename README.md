Linux4win is a Linux Port created in batch, when you first open Linux4win you'll see what would look like bash right? but under the terminal you'll see plain batch code.

The reason why we made this is to welcome people who are new to windows from different operating systems such as Macos, Debian/Ubuntu, and Arch Linux. so they can use their terminal in peace without tutorials on how to use batch or cmd.
